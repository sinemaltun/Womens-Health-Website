# Women's Health Website
Designed for the Web Programming class in Istanbul Technical University's Mathematics department, the Women's Health website aims to support the sharing of knowledge around women's health issues. With a focus on cancer and mental health awareness, sourced from reliable and credited medical sources, and discussion panels, this website acts as a bridge between women seeking information and reliable sources providing that information.
